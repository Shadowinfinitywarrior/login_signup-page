# Animated Login and Signup Page

This project is a simple yet modern login and signup page with an animated background created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login credentials are validated based on the data entered during signup. User data is stored in the browser's local storage (client-side storage), and a dynamic gradient background animation is added to enhance the page’s visual appeal.

## Features
- Login and Signup: Users can sign up and log in using email and password. Data validation is performed before registration and login.
- Local Storage: User data (email, username, and password) is stored in the browser’s `localStorage` for persistence.
- Background Animation: The page includes a dynamic gradient background that transitions smoothly between different colors.
- Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Markup structure for the login and signup forms.
- CSS3: Styling the forms and implementing the animated background gradient.
- JavaScript: Form validation, storing user data in local storage, and managing login/signup transitions.
